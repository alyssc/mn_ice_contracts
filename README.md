# ICE contracts in Minnesota

This is a repository to explore ICE contracts in Minnesota. 
- Relevant data extracts, which come from USAspending.gov, are included in the repository under `data`. 
- `mn_ice_contracts.R` explores the data and creates files for visualization (done in Datawrapper).
- CSV outputs are in `to_visualize`.

I also include some contracts from FPDS.gov under `contracts`. Keeping them here for posterity.
